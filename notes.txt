initial experiments:

higher MSE with wrong model,
but the average of all patches from discriminator seems to be the same



todo:
run loop over all models with all discrims
run loop over all models with all val sets


loop over all models/test image sets

plot somehow?




dev:
reqs.txt
env: sim2real -> make new one

TODO:
For Monday: eval:
- add more metrics to val script
- loop val over all models and save results
- plot results? or table?
- get example image pairs:
  - good
  - bad (ie edge when supposed to be surface)
  - terrible (uninitalised weights etc.)


Trainer
===============================================
--> try lowering LR with some decay to allow models to fine tune
- training:  lower learning rate/save best model based upon train MSE/loss not val SSIM
--------------------------------------

- make a superclass of the trainers to work with single and multitask

- reduce the amount of data to use option on data loaders
- choose what weights are trainable

- Add NLPD loss
- Add SSIM loss




Multitask
===============================================
extend to multitask scenario (wait for new GAN code?)
  - additive losses
  - val on all train tasks - save validation data properly (cols on csv sort out)

Predict or input (surface, edge)




Evaluation: Down stream task
===============================================
Maybe outsource validation function to another file?
- rm old sim2real models




Open question:
- do we need different training set for real2sim and downstream tasks?




Metrics
===============================================
Try different metrics out to eval model's performance (mSSIM, NLPD, euclidean, etc.)
Get examples of high/low SSIM etc.
  - see if they capture what we are after in a similarity

Write up
===============================================
- Aims / Hypothesis
- Experiments
- Graphs


Experiments:
  - How similar are models? -> weights difference
  - Can models perform well on other tasks?
  - How effectively can models be transferred/fine tuned?
    - Computation reduction
    - Data reduction
  - Do we need a model for each task?
    - Model reduction
